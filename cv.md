## About me

I have always been attracted to the IT field and, having started to study Java script, I realized that this is what I would like to do next. Having an analytical mindset and a love for mathematics, I enjoy solving complex and non-trivial problems.
I study in a reasonable time, I approach tasks responsibly and try to complete them completely.
I want to continue my studies and learn new skills in order to become an experienced Frontend Developer.

## Scills

* Html5, css3
*  Sass / scss
* JavaScript

## Code example:

Function that will find all the anagrams of a word from a list: 

```
function anagrams(word, words) {
  let sortedWord = word.split('').sort().join('');
  return  words.filter(word => (word.split('').sort().join('')===sortedWord))
}
```
